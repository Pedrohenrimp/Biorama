## Level Design
The game has 6 maps, 1 map for each Brazilian biome, and each biome has its own resource to be collected. These resources are called Elementary Fragments, and have a visual relationship with the biome. Each map has 7 resources to be collected, and each animal requires 3 resources from its respective biome to be unlocked. The player can only advance to the next biome after unlocking all animals in the current biome.
